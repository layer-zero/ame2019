# Arista Management Essentials 2019.1

These are the files that are required to perform some of the labs in the Arista AME 2019.1.x course.
They are provided here purely for reference and easy download by the students of the Arista AME courses that I teach.

The originals are available as part of larger repository for the Arista ATD Labs at:
